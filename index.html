        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Web/Software Developer in training here. During my teens, I built computers for friends and family, gaining experience
        with hardware/software installation, and some basic IT support. During high school, I briefly experimented with Java, 3D
        modelling for video games, and was big into gaming and creating electronic music. Through certain personal experiences,
        my path took me toward the field of psychology, taking on an interest for cognition and related topics. I pursued
        studies in psychology but still had a big interest in technology, art, and anything related to logic and cognition.
        
        I took a leap of faith within the field and went to a clinical program to train as a therapist. Not long after, I opted
        to leave the program, realizing my interests leaned more toward studying cognition unrelated to clinical science. Fast
        foward to the present, post-graduate school, I have come full circle and am diving head first into tech!</p>
